# 📚 Master List of Important Networking Topics

## 🏛 1. OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection)
**7 Layers:**
- Application Layer (HTTP, FTP, DNS, SMTP)
- Presentation Layer (SSL/TLS, Encoding, Encryption)
- Session Layer (Session Control, API sessions)
- Transport Layer (TCP, UDP, Port Numbers)
- Network Layer (IP, Routing Protocols)
- Data Link Layer (MAC Addressing, Switches, Ethernet)
- Physical Layer (Cables, Wireless, Signals)

**✅ Learn:**
- Layer functions
- Protocols at each layer
- Devices working at each layer
- How data flows (encapsulation and de-encapsulation)

---

## 🛡 2. TCP/IP Model
**4 Layers:**
- Application
- Transport
- Internet
- Network Access (Link)

**✅ Understand:**
- Comparison with OSI
- Real-world usage (TCP/IP powers the Internet!)

---

## 📡 3. Protocols (Core Communication)
**Application Layer Protocols:**
- HTTP, HTTPS (Web)
- FTP, SFTP (File transfer)
- SMTP, IMAP, POP3 (Email)
- DNS (Domain Name System)
- DHCP (Dynamic IP assignment)

**Transport Layer Protocols:**
- TCP (Reliable, connection-oriented)
- UDP (Fast, connectionless)

**Network Layer Protocols:**
- IP, ICMP, ARP

**Routing Protocols:**
- RIP, OSPF, BGP, EIGRP

**✅ Learn:**
- Protocol purpose
- Inter-layer interactions
- Port assignments (e.g., TCP 80 = HTTP)

---

## 🌍 4. IP Addressing and Subnetting
**IPv4 Addressing:**
- 32 bits, 4 octets
- Public vs Private
- Static vs Dynamic
- Subnetting and CIDR

**IPv6 Addressing:**
- 128-bit structure
- Needed due to IPv4 exhaustion
- Types: Unicast, Multicast, Anycast

**✅ Learn:**
- Subnet calculations
- Network, broadcast, host addresses

---

## 🖧 5. MAC Address and ARP
- MAC = Device physical address
- ARP = IP to MAC resolution
- ARP spoofing = security threat

**✅ Understand:**
- MAC vs IP roles
- Risks: MITM, spoofing

---

## 📈 6. Routing and Switching Basics
**Switching:**
- MAC Address Table
- VLANs

**Routing:**

- Default Gateway
- Routing Tables

**✅ Learn:**
- Cross-network communication
- Pathfinding (packet delivery)

---

## 🛜 7. DNS (Domain Name System)
- Translates domains to IPs
- Record types: A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, TXT
- Caching and DNS Attacks (spoofing, tunneling)

**✅ Understand:**
- How DNS works
- Security issues in DNS

---

## 🔥 8. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
- Automatically assigns IPs
- Lease time and DHCP options (DNS, gateway)

**✅ Learn:**
- Static vs Dynamic IP
- DHCP Snooping (security layer)

---

## 🔒 9. Network Security Basics
- Firewalls (packet filtering, stateful inspection)
- VPNs (Virtual Private Networks)
- IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection/Prevention)
- TLS/SSL (encrypted transmission)
- Zero Trust Architecture

**Common Attacks:**
- MITM, Sniffing, Spoofing, DDoS

**✅ Learn:**
