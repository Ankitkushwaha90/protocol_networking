# OSI Model Deep Dive: Layers, Protocols, and Learning Relevance

## Overview
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model defines a seven-layer framework for network communication. Each layer serves a specific role in data transmission and is critical to understanding for networking, cybersecurity, and systems administration.

## Key Layers for Cybersecurity & Networking Focus

- **Layer 3 (Network):** Vital for routing, IP addressing, firewall rules, and VPN.
- **Layer 4 (Transport):** TCP/UDP, port security, encrypted transport (SSL/TLS).
- **Layer 2 (Data Link):** MAC filtering, VLAN isolation, Wi-Fi security.
- **Layer 7 (Application):** Email, web, DNS—targets for phishing, DDoS, injection.
