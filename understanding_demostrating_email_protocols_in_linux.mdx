# Understanding and Demonstrating Email Protocols in Linux: SMTP, IMAP, and POP3

## Slide 1: Title Slide
**Title:** Electronic Mail Protocols: SMTP, IMAP, POP3  
**Presenter:** [Your Name]  
**Date / Institution:** [Insert Date / Institution]

---

## Slide 2: What is Email Communication?
**Visual:** Diagram - Email client ↔ server ↔ recipient

- Email is exchanged using standardized protocols.
- Each protocol serves a specific role in sending or receiving messages.

---

## Slide 3: Key Email Protocols

| Protocol | Purpose           | Port | Encrypted Port |
|----------|-------------------|------|----------------|
| SMTP     | Send mail         | 25   | 465 / 587      |
| IMAP     | Read mail remotely| 143  | 993            |
| POP3     | Download mail     | 110  | 995            |

**Include:** Protocol flow diagram showing interaction between client, server, and protocol roles.

## Slide 4: Protocol Roles Explained

- **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):** Sends messages between servers.
- **IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol):** Allows remote reading and management of email without downloading.
- **POP3 (Post Office Protocol):** Downloads and typically deletes mail from server.

---

## Slide 5: Why These Protocols Matter?

- Core of all email systems (Gmail, Outlook, enterprise mail).
- Critical for **cybersecurity**: identifying spoofing, filtering spam.
- Used in **forensics** and **email monitoring**.

---

## Slide 6: Practical Setup on Linux

**Install SMTP Server (Postfix):**
```bash
sudo apt install postfix
```

**Install IMAP & POP3 Server (Dovecot):**
```bash
sudo apt install dovecot-imapd dovecot-pop3d
```

**Visual:** Include screenshot or video of installation steps.

---

## Slide 7: Live Demo or Video

**Using Telnet to simulate SMTP session:**
```bash
telnet localhost 25
```
**Session Example:**
```
HELO domain.com
MAIL FROM:<you@example.com>
RCPT TO:<user@example.com>
DATA
Subject: Hello
This is test.
.
QUIT
```

---

## Slide 8: Email Testing Tools

- Command-line: `telnet`, `nc`, `mail`, `sendmail`
- Advanced: Wireshark for packet capture

**Optional Demo:** Sniff SMTP packets to show protocol in action

---

## Slide 9: Real-World Applications

- Email spoofing & detection
- Phishing analysis techniques
- Monitoring outbound SMTP to prevent spam
- Reading and analyzing server logs

---

## Slide 10: Summary & Conclusion

- SMTP, IMAP, and POP3 are email infrastructure essentials.
- Linux tools allow full simulation of email flow.
- Skills applicable in cybersecurity, sysadmin, and dev fields.

---

## Slide 11: Q&A

- Open the floor for any questions.
