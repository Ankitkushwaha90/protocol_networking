## Slide 1: Title Slide
**Title:** Electronic Mail Protocols: SMTP, IMAP, POP3  
**Presenter:** [Your Name]  
**Date / Institution:** [Insert Date / Institution]

## Slide 2: What is Email Communication?
**Visual:** Diagram - Email client â†” server â†” recipient

- Email is exchanged using standardized protocols.
- Each protocol serves a specific role in sending or receiving messages.

## Slide 3: Key Email Protocols

| Protocol | Purpose           | Port | Encrypted Port |
|----------|-------------------|------|----------------|
| SMTP     | Send mail         | 25   | 465 / 587      |
| IMAP     | Read mail remotely| 143  | 993            |
| POP3     | Download mail     | 110  | 995            |

**Include:** Protocol flow diagram showing interaction between client, server, and protocol roles.

## Slide 4: Protocol Roles Explained

- **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):** Sends messages between servers.
- **IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol):** Allows remote reading and management of email without downloading.
- **POP3 (Post Office Protocol):** Downloads and typically deletes mail from server.

---

## Slide 5: Why These Protocols Matter?

- Core of all email systems (Gmail, Outlook, enterprise mail).
- Critical for **cybersecurity**: identifying spoofing, filtering spam.
- Used in **forensics** and **email monitoring**.

---

## Slide 6: Practical Setup on Linux

**Install SMTP Server (Postfix):**
```bash
sudo apt install postfix
```

**Install IMAP & POP3 Server (Dovecot):**
```bash
sudo apt install dovecot-imapd dovecot-pop3d
```

**Visual:** Include screenshot or video of installation steps.

---

## Slide 7: Live Demo or Video

**Using Telnet to simulate SMTP session:**
```bash
telnet localhost 25
```
**Session Example:**
```
HELO domain.com
MAIL FROM:<you@example.com>
RCPT TO:<user@example.com>
DATA
Subject: Hello
This is test.
.
QUIT
```

---

## Slide 8: Email Testing Tools

- Command-line: `telnet`, `nc`, `mail`, `sendmail`
- Advanced: Wireshark for packet capture

**Optional Demo:** Sniff SMTP packets to show protocol in action

---

## Slide 9: Real-World Applications

- Email spoofing & detection
- Phishing analysis techniques
- Monitoring outbound SMTP to prevent spam
- Reading and analyzing server logs

---

## Slide 10: Summary & Conclusion

- SMTP, IMAP, and POP3 are email infrastructure essentials.
- Linux tools allow full simulation of email flow.
- Skills applicable in cybersecurity, sysadmin, and dev fields.

## Slide 11: Q&A

- Open the floor for any questions.

## Files to Prepare for Presentation:

- Terminal screenshots or demo script
- Email protocol flow diagram
- Optional: Wireshark capture files for SMTP session

## Likely Questions & Model Answers

### ðŸŽ¯ Basic Questions

**Q1. What is the main purpose of SMTP?**  
SMTP sends emails from a client to a server or between servers.

**Q2. What is the difference between IMAP and POP3?**  
IMAP keeps messages on the server and syncs across devices. POP3 downloads and deletes emails from the server.

**Q3. Why do we need different ports for encrypted and unencrypted email protocols?**  
Separate ports help enforce encryption and distinguish secure vs insecure connections.

**Q4. What happens if SMTP fails? Will the email be delivered?**  
No. If SMTP fails, the message wonâ€™t be sent. The server may retry, then bounce it back.

**Q5. Can IMAP work offline? How?**  
Yes. Email clients cache messages locally, allowing offline access and syncing when online.

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Technical / Practical Questions

**Q6. Which command is used to send an email from Linux terminal?**  
`mail`, `sendmail`, or `mutt`. Example:
```bash
echo "Body" | mail -s "Subject" user@example.com
```

**Q7. How can you test an SMTP server without a mail client?**  
Use `telnet` or `nc` to manually perform an SMTP session.

**Q8. What is the role of Postfix in your setup?**  
Postfix is the MTA that handles sending and receiving messages using SMTP.

**Q9. How does Dovecot help in email handling?**  
Dovecot provides IMAP and POP3 services, allowing users to retrieve email securely.

**Q10. Which log files are important when troubleshooting email issues on Linux?**  
`/var/log/mail.log` and `/var/log/mail.err`

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Cybersecurity Questions

**Q11. How can SMTP be exploited for spamming?**  
If misconfigured, an SMTP server can act as an open relay, sending spam anywhere.

**Q12. What is email spoofing?**  
Faking the senderâ€™s address to deceive the recipient.

**Q13. How can you secure SMTP communication?**  
Use TLS/SSL, enable authentication, and configure SPF, DKIM, DMARC.

**Q14. What is STARTTLS? Why is it important?**  
STARTTLS upgrades an existing insecure connection to a secure one.

**Q15. How can you detect phishing emails at protocol level?**  
Analyze headers and origins, and check for mismatched domain records (SPF/DKIM).

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Advanced Questions

**Q16. What is the difference between SMTPS (465) and SMTP + STARTTLS (587)?**  
SMTPS uses implicit SSL from the start; STARTTLS starts insecure, then upgrades.

**Q17. Why is IMAP preferred over POP3 in modern email clients?**  
It syncs across multiple devices and doesnâ€™t delete mail by default.

**Q18. Explain SMTP authentication mechanisms (PLAIN, LOGIN, CRAM-MD5).**  
They secure logins by encoding or hashing credentials during SMTP authentication.

**Q19. Can you configure Postfix to only allow TLS connections?**  
Yes, by enforcing `smtpd_tls_security_level = encrypt` in the config.

**Q20. How to prevent Postfix from becoming an open relay?**  
Restrict `smtpd_recipient_restrictions` to only allow known networks or authenticated users.
