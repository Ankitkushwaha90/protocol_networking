# Slide 1: Introduction

### What are Internet Protocols?

Standardized rules that allow computers to communicate over networks.

### Focus of This Presentation:

- **Electronic Mail Protocols**: SMTP, POP3, IMAP, MIME  
- **FTP**: File Transfer Protocol

---

# Slide 2: What is Electronic Mail?

A method of exchanging digital messages across the Internet.

**Involves:**

- **Sending messages** (SMTP)  
- **Receiving messages** (POP3, IMAP)  
- **Formatting attachments** (MIME)

---

# Slide 3: Components of Email System

- **Mail User Agent (MUA)** – Email client (e.g., Outlook, Thunderbird)  
- **Mail Transfer Agent (MTA)** – Routes email (e.g., Sendmail)  
- **Mail Delivery Agent (MDA)** – Delivers mail to inbox  
- **Mail Server** – Stores and processes email data

---

# Slide 4: SMTP – Simple Mail Transfer Protocol

**Used for:** Sending emails from client to server or between servers.

**Ports:** 25 (default), 587 (secure)

**Operation:**

```bash
Sender MUA → SMTP Server → Recipient MTA
```
---

# Slide 5: POP3 – Post Office Protocol v3

**Used for:** Downloading emails to local device and deleting from server.

**Ports:** 110 (default), 995 (secure)

**Features:**

- Good for offline access  
- Simple but not suitable for multiple devices

---

# Slide 6: IMAP – Internet Message Access Protocol

**Used for:** Synchronizing and managing email directly on the server.

**Ports:** 143 (default), 993 (secure)

**Features:**

- Access from multiple devices  
- Supports folders and labels  
- Server-based email management

---

# Slide 7: MIME – Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions

**Function:** Extends SMTP to support attachments, multimedia, and non-ASCII text.

**Importance:**

- Enables real-world email functionality (e.g., photos, documents, audio)  
- Works with SMTP, POP3, IMAP

---

# Slide 8: Email Protocol Workflow

**Example Workflow:**

1. Sender writes email in MUA  
2. Sent via SMTP to server  
3. Server sends to recipient’s server  
4. Recipient uses POP3 or IMAP to read

# Slide 9: What is FTP?

**FTP (File Transfer Protocol):**  
A standard protocol for transferring files over a TCP/IP network.

**Used for:**

- Uploading/downloading files  
- Website management  
- Remote file access

---

# Slide 10: How FTP Works

**Client-Server Architecture**

- FTP Client (e.g., FileZilla) connects to FTP Server

**Ports:**

- **Port 21** – Command  
- **Port 20** – Data

**Modes:**

- Active Mode  
- Passive Mode (used in firewalls/NAT)

---

# Slide 11: FTP Commands

**Common FTP Commands:**

- `USER` – Send username  
- `PASS` – Send password  
- `GET` – Download file  
- `PUT` – Upload file  
- `LIST` – List directory  
- `QUIT` – Close session

---

# Slide 12: FTP Security Considerations

- FTP is **not secure by default**  
- Data is sent in **plaintext**

**Secure Alternatives:**

- **FTPS** – FTP over SSL/TLS  
- **SFTP** – FTP over SSH

---

# Slide 13: Comparison Table

| Protocol | Purpose       | Ports   | Security   | Example Use          |
|----------|---------------|---------|------------|----------------------|
| SMTP     | Send email    | 25/587  | TLS/SSL    | Sending mail         |
| POP3     | Receive email | 110/995 | SSL        | Download & delete    |
| IMAP     | Receive email | 143/993 | SSL        | Sync mail            |
| FTP      | Transfer files| 20/21   | Plain/SSL  | Upload/download files|

---

# Slide 14: Real-World Applications

- **Email Protocols:** Used in Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo  
- **FTP:** Website hosting, software distribution, cloud servers

---

# Slide 15: Conclusion

- Email and FTP are core protocols in internet communication.  
- SMTP, POP3, and IMAP manage email sending/receiving.  
- FTP enables efficient file transfers across networks.  
- **Security upgrades** like SFTP and encrypted email enhance privacy.
